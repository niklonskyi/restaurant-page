                <p>
                    Ramen Ichiraku was founded by Teuchi thirty-four years before the start of Part II.
                    Although it is quite small and has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always been popular
                    with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's strong commitment to taste, giving the ramen an almost
                    artistic quality. Like any ramen establishment, Ramen Ichiraku offers various toppings, such as
                    char siu and boiled eggs. In Konoha Hiden, seaweed had been the most popular topping for several
                    years until, after the Fourth Shinobi World War, it was surpassed by naruto.

                    Ramen Ichiraku is Naruto Uzumaki's favourite dining establishment. He eats there regularly – usually
                    stopping by between missions – and he is often joined by Iruka Umino, another
                    frequent customer. Because Naruto has been a loyal customer for most of his life, Teuchi and his
                    daughter, Ayame, were among the few people in Konoha not to treat Naruto with animosity during his
                    youth. Naruto takes Hinata Hyūga to Ramen Ichiraku for their first date; in the anime, this
                    in turn causes Hinata to become a regular customer, to the point that she has won at least one of
                    its eating contests. In Konoha Hiden, Teuchi gives Naruto a lifetime pass for Ramen Ichiraku
                    as a wedding present, which the anime shows to have received heavy use over the following years.
